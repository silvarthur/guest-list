# Guest List API

## About the Project
This API is for creating a list of guests. Each guest has the following
attributes:

* ID;
* Name;
* Address;
* Number of Invites.

Each guest can have extra invites for taking any kind of companion to the event.
This is represented by the attribute Number of Invites.

This API was implemented using Spring Boot and it uses a Postgres database.
